# Elemental

A template project for simple websites without ever compiling a thing.

## Localhost

This project uses browser-sync to serve your site locally while developing. It's totally
optional, but if you like synchronised browser testing, go ahead and run `npm start`, which
should load your site at http://localhost:3000.
